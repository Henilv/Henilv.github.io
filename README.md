# Henil V. – Offensive Security Researcher

I am a Security researcher with focus aligned towards full lifecycle, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure, Web APIs, and microservices through structured threat modeling.


During my Masters I have performed hands-on exploit across system ( Buffer overflow, format string, race conditions), network(packet sniffing/spoofing, protocol spoofing, web3.0/blockchain as part of academia. The labs were educational inhouse developed, open-sourced VM's : [More can be found at](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/). The labs were divided into sections of attack followed by mitigation strategy.
The lab reports and exploits can be found at: [Computer Security Reports](https://github.com/Henilv/Computer_Security-attacks)  

As a security researcher I further honed my skills with hands-on experience in adversarial ML, experimenting with frameworks like CleverHans on datasets such as FMNIST to probe model robustness and explored privacy-preserving ML techniques including Machine Unlearning and Differential Privacy to ensure secure and compliant data handling.
[ML Privacy & Security nb](https://github.com/Henilv/MachineLearning_Privacy-Security)  
Further explored various libraries related to individual/group fairness such as iBM fair 360, Microsoft Fairlearn etc. Used the knowledgebase to further refine and profile IDS/IPS to have fine tuned signature based Indicators of Compromise (IoC), improving detection quality, reducing false positive and improving Key Performance Indicator for the security team.

As an advocate of privacy and technology through regulation (how GDPR inadvertly lead to birth of machine learning, differential privacy etc.) my interest is also aligned towards security vulnerabilities that induce privacy concerns. (Insecure access control leading to P.I.I and I.P theft).

Building on previous work done for IoT sensors and MQTT protocol, further formalized with academia research and state of art IoT attacks: [IoT Edge Sensors_IDS nb](https://github.com/Henilv/IoT-app_sec/tree/main)  

Most recetly as web api & cloud security engineer, I Performed black-box offensive security testing of vehicle & fleet microservices, MQTT Brokers, Over-the-Air (OTA) servers, vehicle to cloud infra with P.A.S.T.A threat modeling under ISO/SAE 21434 & R155/156, Automated security tests to enforce guardrails & strengthen security posture.
I have worked in Product Security Incident Response team (PSIRT) before leveraging my knowledge for onboarding logs, writing custom detections, triaging alerts and periodic threat hunting.



Currently pursuing PhD-level security research with foucs on system hardening and formalization of asset-centric gaps through a layered security approach. This includes finding a balanced security posture which enables more usability/development with quantifiable and mapped attack vectors, acceptance of residual risk with emphasis on post development monitoring & logging.

From a strategic and operational perspective, leveraging security knowledge base to create Digital Forensics & Incident Rich playbooks, scoring metrics, and governance-aligned procedures.
